# ⚡ CodeAlgoVisualizer

An interactive **Data Structures & Algorithms Visualizer** built using pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

This project visually demonstrates how fundamental algorithms and data structures work step-by-step, helping students understand internal operations instead of just memorizing code.

> 🎓 BTech Project – Data Structures & Algorithms  
> 💡 Focus: Concept clarity through real-time visualization

## 🚀 Features

### 🔢 Sorting Algorithms
- ✅ Bubble Sort (step-by-step swapping)
- ✅ Selection Sort (minimum selection per pass)
- 📊 Real-time bar height updates
- 🎯 Highlighted comparisons & swaps
- 🔢 Step counter to track operations
- 🎚 Adjustable array size using slider
- 🔀 Shuffle array instantly

### 🌳 Binary Search Tree (BST)
- 🌱 Random node insertion
- 🌳 Visual representation of root, left & right children
- 🔢 Step counter for insert operations
- ♻ Reset and regenerate tree structure

---

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3 (Modern UI with gradients & glassmorphism effect)**
- **Vanilla JavaScript (No frameworks)**

This project was intentionally built without libraries to deeply understand DOM manipulation and algorithm logic.
